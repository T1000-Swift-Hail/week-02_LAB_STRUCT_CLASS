## Create a struct City . It has the following properties and function
- name : String
- population : Int
- location : String

- func printDescription . This function should print a description of the city struct using the properties . example : "city name: Riyadh. It is located in the center of Saudi Arabia . It has a population of 9 million people.  It has Tuwaiq mountain . The weather in Riyadh is hot is summer, cold in winter."


## Create a class Country. It has the following properties and functions
- name : String
- cities : [City]
- func printDescription . This function prints the name of the country. Then, using a loop on the array cities , call the function city.printDescription()


## Now you want to model our country Saudi Arabia and 5 cities. Following those steps 
-  Create 5 different cities in Saudi Arabia using the struct City 
-  Create saudiArabia using the class Country and initialize it using the 5 cities you created in the last step
-  Call the function saudiArabia.printDescription()
